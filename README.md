# Binary Classifier of COVID-19

## Dataset
This dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital.

All data were anonymized following the best international practices and recommendations. All clinical data were standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation.

## The Challenge: Predict confirmed COVID-19 cases among suspected cases
Based on the results of laboratory tests commonly collected for a suspected COVID-19 case during a visit to the emergency room, the goal is to predict the test result for SARS-Cov-2 (positive/negative).
